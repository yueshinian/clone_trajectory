## Installation

### Building dependencies

1. Build linear solver Mumps **or** HSL

    1. Build mumps
       ```shell
       git clone https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-Mumps.git --depth=1
       cd ThirdParty-Mumps
       ./get.Mumps
       ./configure
       make
       sudo make install
       ```

    2. Build HSL **(recommended for better performance)**
       ```shell
       git clone https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-HSL.git --depth=1
 
       # Obtain a tarball with HSL source code from http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/ipopt/ and unpack this tarball
       gunzip coinhsl-x.y.z.tar.gz
       tar xf coinhsl-x.y.z.tar
 
       # Rename the directory `coinhsl-x.y.z` to `coinhsl`, or set a symbolic link:
       ln -s coinhsl-x.y.z coinhsl
 
       ./configure
       make
       sudo make install
       ```


1. Build and install [IPOPT](https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt)

   ```shell
   sudo apt install wget unzip gfortran liblapack-dev patch pkg-config libmetis-dev
   wget https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt/archive/refs/heads/stable/3.14.zip
   unzip 3.14.zip && cd Ipopt-stable-3.14/
   ./configure && make -j4
   sudo make install
   ```

2. Build and install [CASADi](https://github.com/casadi/casadi)
   ```shell
   wget https://github.com/casadi/casadi/releases/download/3.5.5/casadi-3.5.5-1.tar.gz
   tar -zxvf casadi-3.5.5-1.tar.gz
   cd casadi-3.5.5.1
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake .. -DWITH_IPOPT=ON -DWITH_EXAMPLES=OFF
   make -j4
   sudo make install
   sudo ldconfig
   ```

3. Clone repository to any catkin workspace and compile workspace

   ```shell
   cd ~/catkin_ws/src
   git clone https://github.com/libai1943/CartesianPlanner.git cartesian_planner
   cd .. && catkin_make
   source devel/setup.bash
   ```

Random test case with 6 pedestrians, 3 moving vehicles and 2 static vehicles.

```shell
roslaunch cartesian_planner pedestrian_test.launch
```

**Click anywhere in Rviz window with the `2D Nav Goal` Tool to start planning.**
